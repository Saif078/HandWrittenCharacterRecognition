OCR -- Optical Character Recognition
	It is about recognition of machine printed characters like in books.
	It is less complx considering the fact of less variaations
	It is easier to achieve high level of accuracy with less variations and ignoring 
		distorions in background of an image, they mostly use NN like CNN, LSTM, RNN 
		for detection.

HWCR -- Hand Written Character Recognition
	It specifies on recognizing characters written by human beings.
	It is way more complex due to the huge variety of styles we humans write.
	It is difficult to achieve high accuracy and precision using SVM & NN.
